# 5-Minute PowerPoint Presentation Script: BlueBot (Working Features Focus)

**Presenter:** [Your Name]
**Team:** Hackaholics
**Total Time:** 5 Minutes

---

### **Slide 1: Title Slide** (30 seconds)

**(Visual: BlueBot logo with the tagline "Your AI Financial Assistant, Ready Today.")**

**SPEAKER:**
"Good morning. My name is [Your Name], and we are team Hackaholics.

Financial stress is a major issue in South Africa, but not because people lack banking apps. It's because they lack a financial guide. Today, we're showing you that guide: BlueBot, an AI-powered assistant that's already built and working."

### **Slide 2: The Problem & Our Proven Solution** (1 minute)

**(Visual: A split screen. Left side shows a confused user looking at a complex bank statement. Right side shows the clean, simple BlueBot chat interface.)**

**SPEAKER:**
"The problem is clear: traditional banking is transactional, not conversational. It tells you *what* happened, but not *why* or *what's next*.

Our solution is a conversational AI that provides immediate answers and automates tedious tasks. With BlueBot, users can simply ask questions about their spending in plain language and get instant, intelligent answers. We've moved from complex statements to simple conversations."

---

### **Slide 3: Live Demo Feature 1: The Conversational AI Core** (1 minute)

**(Visual: A screen recording or animation of the `ai-chat.tsx` interface in action. Show a user typing a question like "How much did I spend on groceries last month?" and BlueBot providing a clear answer.)**

**SPEAKER:**
"At the heart of BlueBot is our powerful conversational AI. This isn't just a chatbot; it's powered by a **Multi-AI Orchestration Engine** running on AWS.

This engine intelligently selects the best AI model for any query, ensuring 99.9% uptime and highly accurate responses. It's the resilient brain that makes our app smart and reliable. This core feature is fully implemented and ready."

---

### **Slide 4: Live Demo Feature 2: Intelligent Receipt Scanning** (1 minute)

**(Visual: An animation showing a phone scanning a receipt (`scan-receipt.tsx`), with data being automatically extracted and categorized, powered by AWS Textract.)**

**SPEAKER:**
"Next, we solved one of the most hated financial chores: expense tracking.

Our **Intelligent Receipt Scanning** feature uses AWS Textract to instantly digitize and categorize any receipt. Just take a picture, and BlueBot does the rest. It automatically tracks spending, identifies vendors, and categorizes expenses without any manual entry. This feature works, and it saves users hours of effort."

### **Slide 5: The Value & The Ask** (1 minute)

**(Visual: A summary slide with two columns. Left: "What We've Built" (Conversational AI, Receipt Scanning, Secure AWS Backend). Right: "The Ask" (Partnership, Pilot Program, Investment).)**

**SPEAKER:**
"What we have today is a robust, working application with core features that solve real problems. We have a secure AWS backend, a powerful AI engine, and features that deliver immediate value.

Our vision is to expand on this proven foundation. To do that, we are asking for:
1.  A **strategic partnership** to integrate with Standard Bank's live data.
2.  A **pilot program** to get BlueBot into the hands of 10,000 customers.
3.  An **investment of R15 million** to scale our already-built platform.

We're not asking you to invest in an idea, but to partner with us to scale a solution.

Now, Iâ€™d like to show you these features live."

### **[End of 5-Minute Pitch]**

**Transition to Live Demo (5 minutes)**

"Let me show you that this is real..."

1.  **Conversational AI:** Open the app and ask a direct question about spending. Show the AI's response.
2.  **Receipt Scanning:** Scan a real receipt and watch as the app processes it automatically.
3.  **Show the Backend:** Briefly mention that this is all running on a secure and scalable AWS infrastructure, confirming its feasibility.

**This script is now focused on what you can confidently demonstrate.**
